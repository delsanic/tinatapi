#Tinatapi

An API that provides information useful to travellers

http://api.tinata.co.uk

Tinatapi (pronounced tin-a-tap-e) was created for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Hack 2014 (hosted by Rewired State). #fcohack

This is a service intended to provide an API that joins together data from multiple sources to create a simple way to get lots of useful information in a single call.

It is intended to be used by application and website developers. It is written in nodejs and comprises data from the FCO, humanrightsdata.org and other sources.

It is currently transitioning to hack to a real-world public service. Feel free to use it, but it should be considered beta. See the CHANGELOG for details of changes to the API.
